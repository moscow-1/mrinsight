<h2>Retimer (Redriver) Market Overview</h2>

Retimers and redrivers have enabled longer physical channels in servers and PC since Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) 3.0 was first introduced almost 10 years ago. A redriver is a mostly analog reach extension device designed to boost the high-frequency portions of a signal to counteract the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the interconnect: the central processing unit (CPU) package, system board, connectors and so on. A retimer is a mixed signal analog/digital device that is protocol-aware and has the ability to fully recover the data, extract the embedded clock and retransmit a fresh copy of the data using a clean clock.
