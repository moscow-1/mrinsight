<h2>Microfocus X-ray Tubes Market Overview</h2>

A microfocus X-ray tube is an X-ray tube with a small X-ray emitting area, typically ranging from a few micrometers to several tens of micrometers.

Working Principle:

Electrons generated from the filament are converged and directed at the anode (target), where X-rays are produced.

The area where X-rays are generated is called the focal point.

By reducing the size of the focal point to the micrometer scale, sharp X-ray images with minimal blur are produced, even at high magnifications.
