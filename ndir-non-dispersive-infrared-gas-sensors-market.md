<h2>NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) Gas Sensors Market Overview</h2>

Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensors utilize the infrared absorption characteristics of specific gas molecules—such as CO₂—to measure their concentration in the air.

How NDIR Gas Sensors Work:

•	Infrared Light Source: Emits IR rays through the gas sample in the measuring tube.

•	Gas Absorption: Target gas molecules absorb part of the infrared light at specific wavelengths.

•	Filter & Detector: Remaining IR light passes through a filter and is measured by an infrared detector.

•	Selective Absorption: Ideally, only the target gas absorbs IR at the selected wavelength, but overlaps can occur due to the presence of multiple gases, leading to cross-sensitivity.
