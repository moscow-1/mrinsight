<h2>Non-Fused Switch Disconnector Market Overview</h2>

Non-fused Switch Disconnectors are an electrical safety device designed to power down and isolate a part of an electrical circuit prior to it being serviced or maintained. Non-fused switch disconnectors use a knife-blade or rotary disconnect to break a circuit as opposed to fused versions, meaning they can be reset easily without the need to replace a fuse. Rotary non-fused switch disconnectors open the circuit by rotation of a lever, while knife-blade switch disconnectors use a hinge to lift a lever off its slot and break the circuit.
