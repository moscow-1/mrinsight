<h2>Piezoresistive Strain Gauge Transducers Market Overview</h2>

Piezoresistive strain gauge transducers are one of the most common types of pressure sensors. They used the change in the material”s resistance when stretched to measure pressure. These sensors are suitable for a variety of applications due to their simplicity and robustness.

In the harsh environment of the metal processing industry, achieving the right balance between accuracy, speed, and reliability of the sensing system is of great significance, and the strong demand for strain gauge sensors is attributed to the rapid development of the end-user industry. Numerous applications across industries are seen as a lucrative opportunity for this market. Strain gauge technology has a long history in aerospace applications. Strain gauges are bonded directly to structural load-bearing components. This helps measure stresses along the critical load path of wing deflection. It has long been used to maintain railway safety. Strain gages can be used in mines or where rail lines are placed on top of railroad tracks to measure stress and strain on the rails bonded to each rail. Strain gauges are used to measure the torque applied by a motor, turbine or engine to a fan, generator, wheel or propeller. Such equipment is widely used in power plants, ships, refineries, automobiles and throughout industry. Strain gauges are used in smart bridge technology, which enables efficient and effective real-time monitoring, which helps in thorough inspection of bridges. Evaluate bridges for structural damage on site, including visual inspection, dye penetrant testing, and many other techniques.
