Burn Wet Type is a system that maximizes CO and Nox treatment efficiency through multi-stage combustion by passing the gas generated after use in the semiconductor process directly through the flame. Plasma Wet Type is a system that treats generated gas at a high temperature of 2000 °C or higher using DC Arc Jet Plasma in semiconductor, LCD, LED, OLED, and SOLAR processes. Wet Type is a system that treats water-soluble gas and dust through a high-pressure water pump and fine spray of water. Dry type is a system that treats harmful gases below TLV through physical and chemical adsorption as harmful gases pass through the adsorbent filling tank.

Gas scrubbers, also known as gas abatement systems or gas treatment systems, are commonly used in the semiconductor industry to remove hazardous or unwanted gases from the exhaust streams of semiconductor manufacturing processes. These scrubbers help to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and protect the health and safety of workers.

Semiconductor manufacturing involves various processes that generate hazardous gases, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), toxic gases, and corrosive gases. These gases can be emitted during deposition, etching, cleaning, and other fabrication steps. Gas scrubbers are designed to capture and neutralize or remove these gases before they are released into the environment.
