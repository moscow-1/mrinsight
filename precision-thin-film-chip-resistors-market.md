<h2>Precision Thin Film Chip Resistors Market Overview</h2>

•	Construction:

o	A thin resistive layer (typically Nichrome) is sputtered onto a ceramic, silicon, or glass base (~0.1 µm thick).

o	Resistance is fine-tuned using photo etching or laser trimming.

•	Features:

o	High precision, low noise, tight tolerance, low TCR (Temperature Coefficient of Resistance).

o	Lower parasitic inductance/capacitance than thick film resistors.

o	Higher cost, but superior performance.

•	Applications:

o	High-precision uses: medical equipment, audio systems, measurement devices, and precision controls.

o	Top segment: 0.05% ultra-precision tolerance (~30% market share).

o	Largest application: medical equipment (~30% share).
