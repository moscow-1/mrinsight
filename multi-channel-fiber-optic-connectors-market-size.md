<h2>Multi-Channel Fiber Optic Connectors Market Overview</h2>

Fiber Optic Connector is a device used to connect light from one section of optical fiber to another section of optical fiber. The optical fiber is a long thin cylindrical fiber made from glass or plastic, as tiny as one tenth of a human hair. Since optical fibers are so tiny, fiber optic connectors have to be made with high precision, at the scale of 0.1um which is one hundredth of a human hair.
