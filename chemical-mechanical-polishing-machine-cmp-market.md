<h2>Chemical Mechanical Polishing Machine (CMP) Market Overview</h2>

Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP), also referred to as CMP Polishing, is a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing. It involves the removal of excess material and surface irregularities on wafers to achieve a smooth, flat surface.

How CMP Works

•	CMP uses a slurry that contains:

o	Abrasive particles (grit)

o	Reactive chemical agents

•	The process is a combination of mechanical and chemical actions:

o	Mechanical: Downward pressure is applied to physically polish the wafer.

o	Chemical: Reacts with the wafer surface to enhance material removal.

•	The slurry composition and process parameters are tailored based on the material type (e.g., silicon, copper, oxide layers).

<h2>Chemical Mechanical Polishing Machine (CMP) Key Market Trends  :</h2>

•	Shift Towards 300mm CMP Machines

The demand for 300mm wafer polishing machines is growing rapidly due to increasing semiconductor fabrication at advanced nodes.
