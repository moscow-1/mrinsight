<h2>Rigid-flex PCB Market Overview</h2>

Rigid-flex circuits are a hybrid structure of rigid and flexible PCBs. Rigid and flexible circuits are integrated into a unitary interconnection structure to gain special advantages. The structures can vary widely in terms of materials and layout. In general, the most common materials are polyimide for the flexible circuit portions and FR4 or polyimide laminates for the rigid portions.

<h2>Rigid-flex PCB Key Market Trends  :</h2>

Rise in Demand from Consumer ElectronicsGrowing usage of smartphones, tablets, and wearable tech is increasing demand for compact, durable, and flexible PCBs.

Advancements in Material TechnologiesUse of high-performance materials like polyimide and copper-clad laminates is improving board reliability and performance.

Shift Towards MiniaturizationDevices are getting smaller, and rigid-flex PCBs help save space and reduce weight in complex assemblies.

Increased Use in Automotive ElectronicsAutomotive systems are becoming more electronic-dependent, boosting the need for high-reliability rigid-flex PCBs.
