<h2>Semiconductor Molding Systems Market Overview</h2>

The semiconductor production process consists of wafer manufacturing, wafer testing, chip packaging and testing. Packaging refers to cutting, wire bonding, molding, trim & forming the wafer after production and processing, so that the integrated circuit can achieve electrical and signal connections with external devices while providing physical and chemical protection for the integrated circuit. Molding refers to a plastic molding process in which packaging materials such as epoxy resin mixture are injected into the mold cavity at a certain temperature and pressure, and the devices that need to be protected, such as chips, are wrapped in the plastic, and then solidified into a whole body. The roles of Molding products in semiconductor packaging are as follows: 1. Protective effect. Exposed semiconductor chips will not fail under strict environmental control, but the daily environment does not have the required environmental control conditions at all, so the chips need to be protected by packaging. 2. Supporting effect. The support has two functions. One is to support the chip, which is to fix the chip to facilitate circuit connection. The other is to form a certain shape to support the entire device after the packaging is completed, making the entire device less likely to be damaged.
