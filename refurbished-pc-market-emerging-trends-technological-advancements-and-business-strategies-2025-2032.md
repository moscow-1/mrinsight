<h2>Refurbished PC Market Overview</h2>

Refurbishment is the distribution of products (generally electronics) that have been previously returned to a manufacturer or vendor for various reasons, not sold in the market or new launch of a product. Refurbished products are normally tested for functionality and defects before they are sold to the public. They are repaired by the original manufacturer and resold. A refurbished PC is one that the customer returns to the manufacturer or computer store for any number of reasons. This might be because the owner changed their minds, or because they felt there was a problem and wanted a refund. The computer is then tested, repaired, and worked on to ensure it is in good condition.

Refurbished PCs are pre-owned computing devices that have been restored to like-new condition and functionality. They offer a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative to buying new hardware, making them increasingly popular across both personal and business applications.
