<h2>E-paper Display Signage Market Overview</h2>

E-paper is an electronic device that is designed to look a lot like real paper. Is main difference to a regular display is that is reflects light instead of emitting it. E-paper displays are screens that display text and graphics digitally without losing the positive characteristics of paper. They do not consume much power and, thanks to e-paper technology, are easy on the eyes. Due to the viewing angle stability and high contrast, text can be read very well, especially over a longer period of time, whereas conventional LCD displays lead to eye fatigue in the long run. Since sunlight has little effect on the readability of the E-Ink screen, E-paper displays can be used both indoors and outdoors.
