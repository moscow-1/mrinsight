<h2>Motor Driver IC Market Overview</h2>

Motor Driver ICs are current amplifiers and are an essential component of motor interfacing. The motor driver integrated circuit chip acts as the interface between a microprocessor or microcontroller, and a motor. As microprocessors tend to operate at lower currents, and motors at higher, motor driver ICs are needed to supply current to the motor as needed. As different motors have different signal requirements, a motor driver IC is usually specific to a motor type. it offers motor drivers for brushless DC motors (BLDC,) brushed DC motors, and stepper motors.
