<h2>CMP Polishing Slurry Market Overview</h2>

Chemical Mechanical Polishing/Planarization (CMP) Slurries are abrasive liquid formulations—typically made of non-crystalline inorganic oxides dispersed in deionized water with specialized chemical additives. These slurries are critical consumables in CMP processes, which are integral to semiconductor manufacturing. By chemically and mechanically interacting with wafer surfaces, CMP slurries smooth and level materials after each deposition-etch cycle, ensuring planar surfaces essential for high-precision lithography patterning.
