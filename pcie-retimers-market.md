<h2>PCIe Retimers Market Overview</h2>

A retime is a digital and analog device. It receives the signal and extracts the digital part of it, then it regenerates it as a separately trained link, in both directions. Therefore, the noise (and other imperfections such as jitter), that was originally present, will be eliminated, it is like a fresh start from the re-generated signal.

A PCIe Retimer is a specialized integrated circuit (IC) designed to enhance and extend Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) signal transmission. These devices are essential in complex hardware configurations where PCIe lanes must traverse through connectors, cables, backplanes, or mid-planes, which can introduce signal degradation due to interconnect discontinuities and inter-symbol interference (ISI).
