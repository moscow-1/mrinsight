<h2>Reticle Stockers Market Overview</h2>

A Reticle is a special type of photomask where the data for only part of the final exposed area is present. These space-saving reticle stockers automatically present the appropriate shelf to the user, and an indicator light then illuminates the box or slot. Included is a PC-based reticle management system with optional SECs/GEM to track reticles. It allows users to query the database for reticle status, usage history, and operator transactions.

<h2>Reticle Stockers Key Market Trends  :</h2>

Rising Demand from 300mm Fabs300mm fabs are becoming the dominant application segment due to increasing semiconductor wafer sizes, leading to higher demand for advanced reticle stockers.

Shift Toward Full AutomationThe market is seeing a gradual shift from semi-automatic to fully-automatic systems for improved efficiency and reduced labor costs.

Integration with Reticle Management SystemsModern reticle stockers now feature advanced PC-based systems with capabilities like SECs/GEM for better traceability and monitoring.
