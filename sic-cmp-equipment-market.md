<h2>SiC CMP Equipment Market Overview</h2>

SiC CMP equipment plays a vital role in the polishing process of silicon carbide wafers. With the help of CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) process, the equipment can effectively remove scratches on the surface of silicon carbide wafers, achieve extremely high surface finish, and ensure that the final surface reaches ultra-smooth, flawless and damage-free high quality standards. This processing step is crucial to the subsequent semiconductor manufacturing process because it directly affects the performance and yield level of the final chip.
