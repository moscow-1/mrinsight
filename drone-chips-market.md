<h2>Drone Chips Market Overview</h2>

Unmanned aircraft are referred to as “drones”, or “UAV” for short. UAVs include unmanned helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, multi-rotor aircraft, unmanned airships, unmanned parachute aircraft and other types, which can be divided into military, civilian and consumer categories according to different fields of use. UAVs are divided into airframe structural components, power systems, flight control systems, camera monitoring systems and other architectures. Among them, the flight management and control system, which has an important impact on the stability, reliability of data transmission, accuracy and real-time of the UAV, plays a decisive role in its flight performance. The core of the UAV body is the flight controller, or the main control chip.The assembly of a UAV involves at least 11 types of chips, the core of which are the vision chip, the main control chip and the power chip. These chips support the most core flight control system of the drone, the sensing system, the transmission and delivery of data and the networking settings.
