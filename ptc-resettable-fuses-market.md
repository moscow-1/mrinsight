<h2>PTC Resettable Fuses Market Overview</h2>

PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) resettable fuses are advanced circuit protection components that offer automatic reset capability. Unlike traditional one-time fuses, PTC fuses transition from a low resistance state to a high resistance state during a fault condition (e.g., short circuit), and return to normal operation after cooling down.

PTC resettable fuses are broadly classified into:

•	Ceramic PTC (CPTC): Used in sensitive applications like telecommunications, where post-trip resistance stability is critical.

•	Polymer PTC (PPTC): Widely used in consumer electronics, often referred to as resettable fuses or polyswitches.
