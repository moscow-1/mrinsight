<h2>Optical Data Storage Devices Market Overview</h2>

Optical storage is an electronic storage medium that uses low-power laser beams to record and retrieve digital (binary) data.

Technology: Data is encoded by a laser in the form of tiny pits on the surface of an optical disk, arranged in a spiral track.

This method is reliable for long-term data storage, especially in read-only or archival use cases.

<h2>Optical Data Storage Devices Key Market Trends  :</h2>

Rise of Archival Storage Solutions

Demand for long-term, tamper-proof data storage is driving the popularity of archival discs and M-DISCs.

Blu-ray Technology Dominance

Blu-ray discs continue to dominate the market with over 67% share, due to high capacity and long shelf life.

Shift Towards Cold Data Storage

Optical media are increasingly used for storing cold or infrequently accessed data, especially in large-scale data centers.
