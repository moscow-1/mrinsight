<h2>Optical Amplifiers Market Overview</h2>

Optical amplifiers are a key enabling technology for optical communication networks. Together with wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology, which allows the transmission of multiple channels over the same fiber, optical amplifiers have made it possible to transmit many terabits of data over distances from a few hundred kilometers and up to transoceanic distances, providing the data capacity required for current and future communication networks.

Optical amplifiers are critical components used to boost optical signals directly without the need to convert them into electrical signals. They are widely applied in optical communication networks to enhance signal strength and extend transmission distances.
