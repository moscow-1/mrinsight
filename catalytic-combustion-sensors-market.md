<h2>Catalytic Combustion Sensors Market Overview:</h2>

Catalytic combustion sensors are devices used to detect the presence of flammable gases by measuring the heat released during catalytic oxidation. They function on the principle of thermal effect, where combustible gases are burned in the presence of a catalyst, causing the temperature of the catalyst to rise. This change in temperature is detected as a resistance change in the sensor, which outputs an electrical signal proportional to the concentration of the combustible gas. These sensors are essential for preventing accidents, explosions, and fires by providing early detection of hazardous gases.
