<h2>Polyimide Electrostatic Chuck Market Overview</h2>

Polyimide Electrostatic Chuck (ESC) is a specialized tool used in semiconductor manufacturing to securely hold wafers or substrates during critical processes such as etching, deposition, and lithography. Unlike traditional ceramic ESCs made from materials like alumina or aluminum nitride, polyimide ESCs utilize polyimide, a high-performance polymer, as the dielectric material. This substitution offers several performance advantages, including improved heat resistance, chemical corrosion resistance, and reduced weight.
