<h2>Medical Ultrasonic Probe Cable Market Overview</h2>

Medical ultrasonic probe cables are key transmission lines that connect the ultrasonic probe to the host of ultrasonic diagnostic equipment, and are used to transmit electrical signals and data between the two. They transmit electrical signals converted from high-frequency sound waves emitted and received by the ultrasonic probe to the host for processing, and send control signals from the host to the probe to adjust its working parameters. This cable must have high electrical performance, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility to ensure image quality and operational safety.
