➣ Global MicroLED Market Overview

Micro-LED, also known as microLED, mLED or LED, is an emerging flat panel display technology. Micro-LED displays consist of arrays of microscopic LEDs forming the individual pixel elements. When compared to the widespread LCD technology, Micro-LED displays offer better contrast, response times, and energy efficiency.
MicroLED, which stands for Micro Light-Emitting Diode, represents a cutting-edge display technology that harnesses an array of microscopic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate images and visuals. These tiny LEDs are considerably smaller than conventional ones, measuring just a few micrometers in size.
MicroLED displays present numerous advantages compared to other display technologies like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode). They excel in brightness, contrast ratio, and color reproduction, resulting in exceptionally vivid and lifelike images. Moreover, MicroLED screens operate without the need for a backlight, making them highly energy-efficient and capable of achieving true blacks by individually controlling the light emission of each pixel.
Along with OLEDs, Micro-LED are primarily aimed at small, low-energy devices such as smartwatches and smartphones. OLED and Micro-LED both offer greatly reduced energy requirements compared to conventional LCD systems. Unlike OLED, Micro-LED is based on conventional GaN LED technology, which offers far higher total brightness than OLED produces, as much as 30 times, as well as higher efficiency in terms of lux/W.
