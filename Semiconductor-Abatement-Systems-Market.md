The semiconductor industry uses gases that are toxic, flammable and even harmful for the environment, but also for humans. For example, in the production of microchips. According to national legislation, these gases have to be abated. This means that they are reduced below the respective threshold limit value (TLV). Different gases require different treatment technologies, such as thermal, wet or even a combination of both technologies. The process exhaust gases can then be released into the atmosphere, without harming nature, for a greener world.
Semiconductor abatement systems are specialized equipment and technologies employed in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Their purpose is to effectively manage and eliminate hazardous gases and particles that arise during the fabrication processes.

Semiconductor abatement systems commonly target pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3), as well as particulate matter. The components of these systems typically include exhaust hoods or enclosures, gas scrubbers, chemical filters, thermal oxidizers, and other treatment mechanisms. The specific configuration depends on the particular pollutants that need to be addressed.
