<h2>Wafer Ball Machine Market Overview</h2>

Wafer Ball Machine is a piece of equipment in semiconductor manufacturing, mainly used to permanently connect wafers of different materials. As a part of the back-end engineering of semiconductor production, it is mainly used to perform ball bonding on the electrodes in the chip using bonding metal wires and ceramic cleavers before the wafer is cut, and the wire tails are cut to form protruding electrodes (threads). pillar bump) process. After the ball is planted, the protruding electrodes of the chip are connected through the key flip chip process to form an electronic circuit.
