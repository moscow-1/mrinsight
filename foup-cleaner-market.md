<h2>FOUP Cleaner Market Overview</h2>

The FOUP (wafer storage container) is a container that stores the wafer when moving the wafer to the next process in the semiconductor process. Usually 25 sheets of wafers enter one FOUP, and when moving between processes, particles get into the FOUP and contaminate the wafer. FOUP cleaner which is used in semiconductor cleans FOUP (Front Open Unified Pod) for wafer in manual / auto.
